45. Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. 
The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It 
should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function 
with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a 
color or an optional feature. 
Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was 
stored correctly.
